🌿 Greenden – Project Summary (No Code)

Greenden is a simple and visually appealing plant-store website designed to showcase different types of indoor and outdoor plants. The project focuses on clean UI, smooth animations, and a beginner-friendly layout built entirely using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

The website contains three main pages:

1. Home Page

The Home page introduces the Greenden brand with a hero section, an About Us block, Best Sellers, and customer reviews. It is designed to give visitors a welcoming experience and guide them into the product collection.

2. Products Page

The Products page displays a well-organized grid of plants arranged in two rows. Each product card includes an image, name, and price, along with a smooth hover animation for better user engagement. The layout is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.

3. Contact Page

The Contact page provides a simple form where users can type in their name, email, and message. This page helps simulate basic user communication functionality and completes the three-page structure of a small website.

Navigation & Responsiveness

A sticky navigation bar is included at the top of all pages, allowing users to switch seamlessly between Home, Products, and Contact. Tailwind CSS ensures consistent styling and responsive layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
